[cite_start]Autonomous DevOps Agent with React Dashboard [cite: 4]
[cite_start]Multi-city Hackathon AIML Track [cite: 5]

## [cite_start]BACKGROUND CONTEXT [cite: 6]
Modern software development relies heavily on CI/CD pipelines. [cite_start]However, these pipelines frequently fail due to various issues including code quality issues, logic bugs, syntax errors, type errors, and integration issues between multiple files. [cite: 7] [cite_start]Developers spend 40-60% of their time debugging these failures instead of building new features. [cite: 8] [cite_start]This challenge tasks you to build an agent that can autonomously detect, fix, and verify code issues. [cite: 9]

## [cite_start]CORE CHALLENGE [cite: 10]
[cite_start]Build an Autonomous DevOps Agent with a React Dashboard that: [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]Takes a GitHub repository URL as input via the web interface [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]Clones and analyzes the repository structure [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]Discovers and runs all test files automatically [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]Identifies all failures and generates targeted fixes [cite: 15]
* [cite_start]Commits fixes with [AI-AGENT] prefix and pushes to a new branch [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]Monitors CI/CD pipeline and iterates until all tests pass [cite: 17]
* [cite_start]Displays comprehensive results in a React dashboard [cite: 18]

## [cite_start]REACT DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS [cite: 19]
[cite_start]▲ The React dashboard is the primary interface judges will use to evaluate your agent. [cite: 20] [cite_start]It MUST be production-ready and publicly deployed. [cite: 21]

1. [cite_start]Input Section [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]Text input for GitHub repository URL [cite: 23]
* [cite_start]Text input for Team Name (e.g., "RIFT ORGANISERS") and Text input for Team Leader Name (e.g., "Saiyam Kumar") [cite: 24]
* [cite_start]"Run Agent" or "Analyze Repository" button [cite: 25]
* [cite_start]Loading indicator while agent is running [cite: 26]

2. [cite_start]Run Summary Card [cite: 27]
* [cite_start]Repository URL that was analyzed [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]Team name and team leader name [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]Branch name created (TEAM_NAME_LEADER_AI_Fix) [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]Total failures detected and total fixes applied [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]Final CI/CD status badge: PASSED (green) / FAILED (red) [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]Total time taken (start to finish) [cite: 33]

3. [cite_start]Score Breakdown Panel [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]Base score: 100 points [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]Speed bonus applied (+10 if <5 minutes) [cite: 36]
* [cite_start]Efficiency penalty (-2 per commit over 20) [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]Final total score displayed prominently [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]Visual chart/progress bar showing score breakdown [cite: 39]

4. [cite_start]Fixes Applied Table [cite: 40]
* Table with columns: File | Bug Type | Line Number | Commit Message | [cite_start]Status [cite: 41, 42]
* [cite_start]Bug types: LINTING, SYNTAX, LOGIC, TYPE_ERROR, IMPORT, INDENTATION [cite: 43]
* [cite_start]Status: Fixed or Failed [cite: 44]
* [cite_start]Color coding: Green for success, red for failure [cite: 45]

5. [cite_start]CI/CD Status Timeline [cite: 46]
* [cite_start]Timeline visualization showing each CI/CD run [cite: 47]
* [cite_start]Pass/fail badge for each iteration [cite: 48]
* [cite_start]Number of iterations used out of retry limit (e.g., "3/5") [cite: 49]
* [cite_start]Timestamp for each run [cite: 50]

## [cite_start]BRANCH NAMING REQUIREMENTS [cite: 51]
[cite_start]▲ CRITICAL: Your agent MUST create branches with this EXACT format: TEAM_NAME_LEADER_NAME_AI_Fix [cite: 52]

[cite_start]Naming Rules: [cite: 53]
* [cite_start]All UPPERCASE [cite: 54]
* [cite_start]Replace spaces with underscores () [cite: 55]
* [cite_start]End with _Al_Fix (no brackets) [cite: 56]
* [cite_start]No special characters except underscores [cite: 57]

| Team Name | Leader Name | Branch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| RIFT ORGANISERS | Saiyam Kumar | [cite_start]RIFT_ORGANISERS_SAIYAM_KUMAR_AI_Fix [cite: 58] |
| Code Warriors | John Doe | [cite_start]CODE_WARRIORS_JOHN_DOE_Al_Fix [cite: 58] |

## [cite_start]TEST CASE MATCHING [cite: 59]
[cite_start]EXACT FORMAT REQUIRED [cite: 60]
[cite_start]▲ CRITICAL: Your agent's output MUST match our test cases line-by-line. [cite: 61]
[cite_start]Judges will evaluate based on exact matches: [cite: 62]

| Test Case | Expected Dashboard Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| Line 15: Unused src/utils.py import 'os' | [cite_start]LINTING error in src/utils.py line 15 Fix: remove the import statement [cite: 63] |
| src/validator.py - Line 8: Missing colon | [cite_start]SYNTAX error in src/validator.py line 8→ Fix: add the colon at the correct position [cite: 63] |
